    "- **31 is chosen as the multiplier** because it is a prime number. Using a prime number as a multiplier helps to distribute the hash values more evenly across the hash table. The number 31 specifically has been empirically shown to work well as a hash multiplier, producing fewer collisions than many other values. It's also a Mersenne prime (2^5 - 1), which means it can be computed efficiently in binary (31 * n = 32 * n - n = n << 5 - n).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **101 is used for the modulo operation** because it's also a prime number. When using the modulo operation to fit hash values into a hash table, using a prime number helps minimise collisions. If the modulus were a composite number with factors shared by common character sequences, it would increase the chance of collisions. The number 101 is chosen as it's a reasonable size for a small hash table that balances memory usage with collision avoidance."
