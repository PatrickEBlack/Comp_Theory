## Project Overview
This repository contains the solutions for the Computational Theory assignments. The project implements and analyses various fundamental concepts in computational theory including:

1. **Binary Representations** - Implementation of bitwise operations used in cryptographic hash functions
2. **Hash Functions** - Analysis of a multiplicative hash function from "The C Programming Language"
3. **SHA256** - Implementation of SHA-256 padding algorithm
4. **Prime Numbers** - Comparison of two algorithms for finding prime numbers
5. **Binary Representation of Roots** - Calculating binary representations of irrational square roots
6. **Proof of Work** - Exploring the concept behind blockchain mining through hash analysis
7. **Turing Machines** - Implementation of a Turing machine that adds 1 to a binary number
8. **Computational Complexity** - Analysis of the bubble sort algorithm's performance characteristics
